# Spellforged
Game Code

Please excuse any weird names in the code its mostly cause I work alone and I name the variables funny things that I understand, If I was working in a team I would not do that!

This is everything I have coded for my newest game Spellforged. I understand that some of these systems need to be refactored and cleaned up but for now they work for a solo developer.
